- Workshop Description:

This workshop invites participants to step beyond the technical layers of blockchain and enter a space of philosophical reflection, cultural analysis, and civic imagination.

We will explore together:

Why Europe leads in digital identity, privacy, and governance — yet struggles to scale blockchain innovation.

How Web3 can be designed to serve society, not just capital.

What it means to build a “human blockchain” aligned with dignity, rights, and responsibility.

The session merges mediterranean humanism with decentralized technologies, asking:

Can blockchain reflect our values, not just our code?

- Objectives:

Rethink blockchain adoption through the lens of culture, policy, and philosophy.

Co-create a shared vision of European digital sovereignty grounded in trust and inclusion.

Identify collective actions and partnerships to advance ethical, people-first blockchain infrastructure.

-Target Audience:

Digital policy thinkers

Web3 builders and researchers

Civic tech innovators

Cultural and ethical thought leaders

Students and citizens with a stake in digital futures

- Why This Workshop Matters at NAPULETH:

In a city where philosophy, culture, and citizenship were born in dialogue — Naples — this workshop reclaims the spirit of polis for the digital age. It invites critical engagement, shared imagination, and a grounded approach to interoperability as a cultural choice.

        talkDescription: "Security monitoring of in-production smart contracts is a major piece of the security infrastructure we haven’t yet managed to fully solve. State-of-the-art solutions of deploying monitoring agents are either (i) easy to deploy but are too general (lack the domain insight about the protocol), or, (ii) too ad-hoc, and are not designed to express high-level protocol properties at scale. This results in low signal to noise ratio and poor fidelity of warnings. In this talk I will show how we build effective monitoring agents using a new metalanguage which we’ve recently made available. The metalanguage is designed to express queries of smart contract dynamic or static properties. It borrows concepts from differential dataflow, and is implemented on top of a database designed to maintain a global, consistent view of blockchain data. Monitoring agents in this language generate high-performance relational queries using time-series tables, delta-relations, incrementally materialized views, and JIT chain data decoding. I will show examples of immediate detections of rugpulls, hacks, detecting arbitrage opportunities and breaking of complex invariants in real time.",

In this talk, I will explore how blockchain and decentralized infrastructure can optimize data for AI agents—reducing computational waste and driving smarter, more sustainable systems.

Topics include:
- How bad data causes unnecessary emissions and inefficiencies in AI systems
- The role of Web3 in providing trust-minimized data pipelines for autonomous agents
- How smart incentives and tokenization can align data quality with sustainability goals
- What a regenerative data economy looks like—and why it matters now

        talkDescription: `
        When people think about stablecoins, they often imagine them as a safer on-ramp for crypto speculation. But in many parts of the world, they represent something far more profound — financial empowerment. As the Head of International Markets at Agora, a VanEck-backed stablecoin company, I’ve had a front-row seat to this transformation across emerging markets.

In this presentation, I’ll explore a provocative question: What if the biggest disruption to traditional banking in the next decade doesn’t come from new fintech apps, but from stablecoins quietly replacing savings accounts, FX services, and cross-border payments?

We'll start by examining the failures of the traditional banking system to evolve over the past 50 years, where intermediaries have only multiplied. I’ll then walk through how stablecoins — programmable, interoperable, and globally accessible 24/7 — are finally solving the "chicken-and-egg" adoption dilemma.

This isn’t just theory. We’ll look at real survey data from markets like Nigeria, Turkey, and Brazil showing that nearly half of users already use stablecoins to save, earn yield, or escape inflation — not to trade memes.

I'll also share why tokenization and yield-bearing stablecoins are the next evolution — enabling users not just to store value, but to grow it. As traditional finance struggles to serve the 1.7 billion unbanked and underbanked, stablecoins are building a parallel system — one transaction at a time.

        talkTitle: "How blockchain technology embodies classical philosophy ",
        talkDescription: `
        What do Plato, Rousseau, and Vitalik Buterin have in common? This thought-provoking session explores how blockchain technology is inadvertently implementing centuries-old philosophical ideas. Presenting how smart contracts embody social contract theory, examine how DAOs reflect classical political philosophy, and analyze how NFTs challenge our metaphysical understanding of value and ownership.
Drawing from both practical Solidity examples and philosophical frameworks, this talk bridges the gap between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete blockchain implementations.

The talk will be rather technical and perform live samples on different chains. I will demonstrate ChainScript (which is NOT my core product) to cover most of the challenges of an ever-changing infrastructure: High-level commands for migrating a user-base from a dying chain to some prosperous new chain. ChainScript is an EVM compatible scripting language, it is an abstraction of ENS APIs on 15 different chains.",

Leveraging a 'stock and flow' macroeconomic model inspired by dynamical systems theory, we analyze the risk of excessive staking and its interaction with inflationary and deflationary forces. Our findings reveal that moderate inflation can serve as a mechanism to curb runaway staking, while overly aggressive deflationary strategies risk exacerbating governance centralization. This talk highlights the critical importance of balanced macroeconomic interventions, supported by quantitative modeling and simulations, to sustain Ethereum's decentralized architecture and ensure its long-term economic resilience.",
