I professionally entered the 'blockchain for business' space in 2016 when working at IBM, running numerous POCs with the more disparate industries - finance, energy, supply chain, insurance, you name it - almost the totality of which got vaporized in thin air. Why? I continued my career as a Solutions Architect, first in Consensys and then Chainlink Labs (currently), working with the same clients on similar use cases. What changed? I would like to share these answers and lessons learned, retrospecting and looking at what the future has to offer by bridging these two worlds together.",

ECF Pensieve directly supports this vision by enabling communities to build resilient knowledge bases governed through social consensus, not institutional authority. It treats knowledge as a public good—something to be collectively maintained, verified, and improved over time. This shifts the power of information governance away from monopolistic platforms and toward composable, transparent, and participatory systems.",

        description: "Security monitoring of in-production smart contracts is a major piece of the security infrastructure we haven’t yet managed to fully solve. State-of-the-art solutions of deploying monitoring agents are either (i) easy to deploy but are too general (lack the domain insight about the protocol), or, (ii) too ad-hoc, and are not designed to express high-level protocol properties at scale. This results in low signal to noise ratio and poor fidelity of warnings. In this talk I will show how we build effective monitoring agents using a new metalanguage which we’ve recently made available. The metalanguage is designed to express queries of smart contract dynamic or static properties. It borrows concepts from differential dataflow, and is implemented on top of a database designed to maintain a global, consistent view of blockchain data. Monitoring agents in this language generate high-performance relational queries using time-series tables, delta-relations, incrementally materialized views, and JIT chain data decoding. I will show examples of immediate detections of rugpulls, hacks, detecting arbitrage opportunities and breaking of complex invariants in real time.",

Our findings reveal that moderate inflation can serve as a mechanism to curb runaway staking, while overly aggressive deflationary strategies risk exacerbating governance centralization. This talk highlights the critical importance of balanced macroeconomic interventions, supported by quantitative modeling and simulations, to sustain Ethereum's decentralized architecture and ensure its long-term economic resilience.",

Di particolare rilevanza sarà anche l'aspetto fiscale inerente alle criptovalute.",
