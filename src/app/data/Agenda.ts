I would like to share these answers and lessons learned, retrospecting and looking at what the future has to offer by bridging these two worlds together.",

        description: "Security monitoring of in-production smart contracts is a major piece of the security infrastructure we haven’t yet managed to fully solve. State-of-the-art solutions of deploying monitoring agents are either (i) easy to deploy but are too general (lack the domain insight about the protocol), or, (ii) too ad-hoc, and are not designed to express high-level protocol properties at scale. This results in low signal to noise ratio and poor fidelity of warnings. In this talk I will show how we build effective monitoring agents using a new metalanguage which we’ve recently made available. The metalanguage is designed to express queries of smart contract dynamic or static properties. It borrows concepts from differential dataflow, and is implemented on top of a database designed to maintain a global, consistent view of blockchain data. Monitoring agents in this language generate high-performance relational queries using time-series tables, delta-relations, incrementally materialized views, and JIT chain data decoding. I will show examples of immediate detections of rugpulls, hacks, detecting arbitrage opportunities and breaking of complex invariants in real time.",

It illustrates an EVM middleware that abstracts from particular blockchains, handles node redundancy and fail-over, and wraps API calls into atomic pieces of JS code that create context and relevant feedback for user-friendly dApp development. The talk will be rather technical and perform live samples on different chains. I will demonstrate ChainScript (which is NOT my core product) to cover most of the challenges of an ever-changing infrastructure: High-level commands for migrating a user-base from a dying chain to some prosperous new chain. ChainScript is an EVM compatible scripting language, it is an abstraction of ENS APIs on 15 different chains.",

Leveraging a 'stock and flow' macroeconomic model inspired by dynamical systems theory, we analyze the risk of excessive staking and its interaction with inflationary and deflationary forces. Our findings reveal that moderate inflation can serve as a mechanism to curb runaway staking, while overly aggressive deflationary strategies risk exacerbating governance centralization. This talk highlights the critical importance of balanced macroeconomic interventions, supported by quantitative modeling and simulations, to sustain Ethereum's decentralized architecture and ensure its long-term economic resilience.",
